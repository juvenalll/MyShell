<p>
Excuse me... do you want a <i>shell?</i>
Here use  this don't be <i>shy</i> it's simple to use!
</p>

<p>It already comes with many <b>commands</b> !</p>

<h3> Builtin Commands </h3>
<ul>
<li>cd</li>
Typed alone this takes you to your "home" directory, but "cd $subdirectory" takes you to that directory
<li>clr</li>
This command clears everything on the screen giving you just the line you are typing into
<li>dir</li>
Lists everything contained in the directory you are working in 
<li>echo</li>
Prints out whatever is typed next to it in a new line
<li>environ</li>
Prints out all "environment variable" of your current environment
<li>help</li>
Gives you a list of builtin commands and an uplifting message
<li>pause</li>
Pauses the shell to wait for user to press any key followed by the enter key
<li>quit</li>
Closes the application and returns you to where yu were when you first called myshell
</ul>

<p>A user can also call other commands that are not builtin as long as they are valid </p>

<b>This only supports one command at a time and does not work with piping or redirection! </b>
